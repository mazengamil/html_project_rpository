<p>
TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript is an object-oriented language that was introduced to extend the capabilities of JS. The language makes it easy for developers to write and maintain codes. TypeScript offers a complete description of each component of the code and can be used for developing large applications with a strict syntax and fewer errors. 

Further, it is well-structured and easy to learn. Its extended toolbox makes application development quick. Owing to the benefits it offers, TypeScript is expected to supercede JS in 2020, making it one of the most sought-after programming languages in the future.
